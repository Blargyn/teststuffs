SCSS is just css with a few extra fun things
You won't be using most of them, however, the most important one is nesting

Your code:
.same .thing {
  PROPERTIES
}
.same .other-thing {
  PROPERTIES
}

Can look like this:

.same {
  .thing {
    PROPERTIES
  }
  .other-thing
}

and this all gets dumped into styles.css, if you want to see the output
*/

.same {
  color: green;
}
